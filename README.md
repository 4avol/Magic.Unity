MAGIC Unity Integration
=======================

[Unity](https://unity.com/) integration for the [MAGIC compiler](http://nas.sr/magic/).

This repository is built from the MAGIC repository and contains a user interface and API designed to work with the Unity Editor and C# scripting with a particular focus on iOS export.

Overview
--------
This integration offers an AOT based workflow to integrate Clojure into Unity. The basic workflow is as follows:

1. Clone this repository or download and extract its archive into your Unity project
2. Write Clojure your namespaces in `clj` files as usual, placing them under the Assets folder
3. Open the compiler window by navigating to MAGIC > Compiler...
4. Use the compiler window to configure your class path and choose the root namespaces to compile
5. Press the compile button
6. Write Unity components in C# as usual, using the a Magic.Unity API to require your Clojure namespaces and invoke your functions
7. Playing in the editor and exporting work as expected
8. If you change your Clojure source repeat step 5

API
---
This repository exposes its own API into the Clojure runtime in addition to the API provided by ClojureCLR (under the `clojure.lang.*` namespaces). When possible, our APIs should be preferred over the ClojureCLR APIs because they take into consideration Unity-specific issues.

The stable API is under the `Magic.Unity.Clojure` namespace. The experimental API is under the `Magic.Unity.Clojure.Alpha` namespace.

### `void Magic.Unity.Clojure.Require(string ns)`

Required a Clojure namespace. This must be done before looking up any vars in the namespace.

### `clojure.lang.Var Magic.Unity.Clojure.GetVar(string ns, string name)`

Looks up and returns a Clojure var in a namespace. This var can be dereferenced with `deref` or invoked with `invoke`.

### `void Magic.Unity.Clojure.Boot()`

Initializes the Clojure runtime. This is done automatically by the other API methods and generally does not need to be called by end users.
