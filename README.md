MAGIC Unity Integration
=======================

[Unity](https://unity.com/) integration for the [MAGIC compiler](http://nas.sr/magic/).

This repository is built from the MAGIC repository and contains a user interface and API designed to work with the Unity Editor and C# scripting with a particular focus on iOS export.

API
---


This repository exposes its own API into the Clojure runtime in addition to the API provided by ClojureCLR (under the `clojure.lang.*` namespaces). When possible, our APIs should be preferred over the ClojureCLR APIs because they take into consideration Unity-specific issues.

The stable API is under the `Magic.Unity.Clojure` namespace. The experimental API is under the `Magic.Unity.Clojure.Alpha` namespace.

### `void Magic.Unity.Clojure.Require(string ns)`

Required a Clojure namespace. This must be done before looking up any vars in the namespace.

### `clojure.lang.Var Magic.Unity.Clojure.GetVar(string ns, string name)`

Looks up and returns a Clojure var in a namespace. This var can be dereferenced with `deref` or invoked with `invoke`.

### `void Magic.Unity.Clojure.Boot()`

Initializes the Clojure runtime. This is done automatically by the other API methods and generally does not need to be called by end users.
